This file contains the raw 3D models designed for augmenting both the 1/10 scale autonomous vehicle IAG's Research & Development team are developing, as well as some of the road-side infrastructure that will be used for traffic control.

The 3D files were developed in TinkerCAD, which is a free online editing tool.  The STL or OBJ files contained in the zip folder  should be able to be re-imported for future editing.  Note that some of the designs will definately need support structures and rafts to print cleanly, and these have not been added here, as each printer requires a different approach to printing support.
